OpenDXL Streaming Consumer Python Client Library
================================================

Overview
--------

The OpenDXL Streaming Consumer Python client library is used to consume records
from a
`Data Exchange Layer <http://www.mcafee.com/us/solutions/data-exchange-layer.aspx>`_
(DXL) Streaming Consumer Service.

The DXL Streaming Consumer Service exposes a REST-based API that communicates
with a back-end streaming platform (Kafka, Kinesis, etc.). The consumer service
performs authentication and authorization and exposes methods to retrieve
records.

Concrete examples of DXL Streaming Consumer Services include the
`McAfee Investigator <https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/products/investigator.html>`_
"Events feed" and the
`McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator <https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-au/products/epolicy-orchestrator.html>`_
"Threat event feed".
