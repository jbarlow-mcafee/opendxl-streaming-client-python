====================

Prerequisites
*************

* Python 2.7.9 or higher in the Python 2.x series or 3.4 or higher in the Python 3.x series installed within a Windows or Linux environment.

Installation
************

Use ``pip`` to automatically install the library:

    .. parsed-literal::

        pip install dxldbconsumerclient-\ |version|\-py2.py3-none-any.whl

Or with:

    .. parsed-literal::

        pip install dxldbconsumerclient-\ |version|\.zip

As an alternative (without PIP), unpack the dxldbconsumerclient-\ |version|\.zip (located in the lib folder) and run the setup
script:

    .. parsed-literal::

        python setup.py install
